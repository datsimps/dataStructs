# dataStructs
The project itself is a data structures class projects from college. Just to gloss over the finer things of the project is about binary search tree and recursive function calls.
The project should read in from a file and then set up a tree from the numbers the "input.txt" file provides. I have a number function to convert the string numbers to integers. A previous teacher instructed the class on the merits of single concerns in functions/classes and it stuck. After reading in the numbers and setting up the tree, we should be able to print out the numbers between an upper and lower bound. The key is not to traverse the tree to unnecessary nodes.

As with all projects I have on the repo, I am a student first and foremost. If errors are found, I would love to learn how to correct them. Thank you, I wish you the best.
